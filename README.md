# 🧠 DSA in Java

Welcome to my **DSA in Java** repository! 🚀  
This repo is my personal space for mastering **Data Structures and Algorithms** — implemented purely in **Java** with clean, optimized, and easy-to-understand code.  
I’ve added every concept I’ve learned, from **Arrays to Graphs**, covering both **basic to advanced topics** step by step.  

## 📚 What’s Inside
- 🧩 Core DSA implementations — Arrays, Strings, Stacks, Queues, Linked Lists, Trees, Graphs, etc.  
- ⚙️ Problem-solving approaches — LeetCode, GFG-style problems.  
- 🔁 Sorting, Searching, Recursion, and Backtracking algorithms.  
- 🌲 Graph algorithms — DFS, BFS, Topological Sort, Cycle Detection, and more.  
- 🧮 Dynamic Programming problems *(coming soon 😉)*  
- 💡 Well-structured, beginner-friendly code with proper function separation and comments.

## 🎯 Why This Repo
This repo documents my DSA learning journey — each problem and algorithm is coded from scratch with clear logic.  
It’s great for:
- Students prepping for **placements** 🧑‍💻  
- Developers brushing up on **Java DSA concepts**  
- Anyone who wants to **learn by example**

## 🛠️ Tech Stack
- **Language:** Java ☕  
- **IDE:** IntelliJ IDEA / VS Code  
- **Version Control:** Git + GitHub  

## 🌟 Future Plans
- Add **Dynamic Programming** and **Greedy Algorithms**  
- Include **Time and Space Complexity** notes  
- Add **Test cases and visual explanations**
